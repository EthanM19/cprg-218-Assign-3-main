                    In this video I show the work I did to revamp Precision Drilling's Career page. This was one of the bigger projects I did in my internship. If you go to <a href="https://www.precisiondrilling.com/careers/">their Carreer Page</a>. The main difference's shown in the video are that the first part showing the different carreerss have added animations that bring up the detials of each field. I also added animation to all of the elments on the page, as you scroll down its much more interactive then being the stale page they had before. Another big change was making the "Principles We Stand By" a scroll wheel where when you click it brings up the principles in much more detail. I also added a career fair section.
